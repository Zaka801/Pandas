Section 1:

Q:1: Creates a Pandas Series with custom indices and prints it.
Q:2: Creates a Pandas Series from a dictionary and prints it.
Q:3: Creates a Pandas DataFrame from a dictionary and prints it.
Q:4: Extends Q:3 by setting custom indices for the DataFrame and prints it.
Q:5: Extends Q:3 by calculating mean, maximum, and minimum values for the 'temperature' column and prints them.
Section 2:

Q:6: Reads a CSV file ('people.csv'), selects specific columns, sets 'Sex' and 'Job Title' as index columns, skips certain rows, and exports the modified DataFrame to a new CSV file ('NewPeople.csv').
Q:7: Reads an Excel file ('SampleWork.xlsx'), imports specific columns from sheet 1, sets row 2 as the header, skips certain rows, and exports the modified DataFrame to a new sheet in the same Excel file ('SampleWork.xlsx').
Section 3:

Q:8: Creates a DataFrame named AICP_DF from a dictionary, selects specific columns 'Name' and 'Qualification' and saves them to df1, adds a new column 'Height' to AICP_DF, sets 'Name' column as the index column, retrieves rows with specific indices ('Hifza' and 3), and drops a row with index 'Bilal'.
